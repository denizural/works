## WRF Climate Modelling:
---
* **860hPa_comparison.png:** monthly comparison of the NCEP Reanalysis data, RegCM and WRF 850 hPa wind and temperature outputs.

* **parallel_ncores_vs_efficiency.png:** parallel efficiency of the WRF model at the Turkish National Supercomputing Center with the specific model configurations. These configurations result in the best simulation results but necessarily the fastest ones. 

* **parallel_ncores_vs_speedup.png:** parallel speed-up of the WRF model

* **precipitation_comparison.png:** monthly comparison of the CRU data, RegCM and WRF precipitation outputs.

* **precipitation_taylor_plot.png:** Taylor plot of the comparison of the RegCM and WRF outputs.

* **t2m_comparison.png:** monthly comparison of the CRU data, RegCM and WRF 2m temperature outputs.

* **t2m_station_model_comparison.png:** comparison of the 2m temperature from meteorological station and WRF simulation.
